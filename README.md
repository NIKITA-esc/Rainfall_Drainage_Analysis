# Rainfall & Drainage Analysis Project 🌧️

This project analyzes rainfall and drainage data for different areas of Chandigarh. using **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**.  
It includes:
- Peak rainfall calculation per area
- Drainage capacity comparison
- Visualization of rainfall patterns (bar graphs, styled plots)
  
# Purpose
As we see the condition of chandigarh was very bad during this monsoon 
I analyzed drainage capacity and suggest to improve the design of chandigarh drainage sysytem
